# My Website Portfolio

Welcome to my (unfinished) website portfolio! Although I have made a naive website before this is my first website that I have made completely on my own!
I hope to be updating this site over time, populating it with different works and projects that I have completed. I've started this just as I am about to graduate in August 2023. Despite web development being somewhat outside of my degree of Machine Learning and Data Science, I've always wanted to make a cool site full of my own art work and my own coding work; a beautiful mesh of both things I love!

## Introduction

Thank you for visiting my website portfolio repository. I'm passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites that deliver a seamless user experience. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my creativity, technical abilities, and ability to explore new endeavours. 

I hope being able to look into this site would be like meeting me in some way!


## Technologies Used

During the development of this portfolio, I've utilized a variety of technologies, including:

- HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the website.
- (Soon) JavaScript and jQuery for interactive elements
- Git for version control and collaboration.
- Visual Studio Code as my code editor. 

To have auto refresh when making changes:
1. Go to the Extensions tab in VS Code
2. Search "Live Server" and install the first extension you see
3. Click on the file that you are working on
4. Press ALT+L+O to open a live server for that specific file

## Future Plans

I'm committed to continuously improving this portfolio to provide a better experience for visitors. Here's what you can expect in the near future:

- Developing new sections of the website, writing up sufficient information that can be viewed in various ways
- Adding more experiences with detailed descriptions, and original artwork.
- Refining the design and layout for a more polished and professional appearance.

I'm excited about the potential of this portfolio and the opportunity to showcase my skills. Your patience and understanding as I work towards completion are greatly appreciated.
