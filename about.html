                            A Valorant inspired WIP that I drew on my iPad.

                        <p id="video_games">
                            The first being video games! Iâ€™ve always loved video games, ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve been playing games. When I was younger, 
                            I didnâ€™t have any gaming consoles, so I turned to PC gaming as my main source of games. I went from gaming on an old family laptop from the 
                            mid 2000â€™s to now having built my own PC. I must say I donâ€™t miss the days of getting under 10 fps (frames per second) in Minecraft, 
                            but it definitely helps me appreciate what I have now. In terms of genres, I spend most of my time on first person shooter games like 
                            Valorant or life simulation games such as Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley.  However, I like to dabble in anything else my friends 
                            bring up and am always open to trying something new!
                        </p>
                        <h5>Weight Training</h5>
                        <p id="weight_training">
                            Next hobby on the list would be strength training and overall fitness. This has been a much more recent endeavor, as I have only really 
                            been doing it for almost 2 years now, but I love feeling like I am taking care of myself. I feel like it has brought a nice routine to my 
                            life and gets me off the computer for a few hours a day. I also enjoy goal setting and keeping myself motivated to improve on something. 
                            Being aware of how food can affect your body as well has been very insightful and I feel like Iâ€™ve learned a lot about myself in the process. 
                            I think itâ€™s brought a lot of balance; and, I mean, who doesnâ€™t want to be able to lift (relatively) heavy things?
                        </p>
                        <h5>The Arts</h5>
                        <p id="the_arts">
                            Last but definitely not least would be art. As you can hopefully tell by the site, I love to create things that are visually appealing. This 
                            has always been a constant in my life and has spilled and infiltrated many other aspects. Iâ€™m sure I could go on for hours, and Iâ€™ve already 
                            mentioned it above, but instead Iâ€™ll just show you a few of my pieces ðŸ˜Š.

Iâ€™ve tried to keep this consistent throughout the years, some of which Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll share with you here. In fact, most of the imagery used on this site is original digital art that I created for the site, fresh new content just for your viewing! I guess you can say I feel a sense of accomplishment when I can create something, through the ideation, the creation, and of course the finalization. Feeling like I was able to create something has always been a feeling I craved. So luckily, I found a career that enables me to do so, itâ€™s a different media and a very different output but still most definitely is a creation; this surely helps with problem solving as well."; // Replace the text content
